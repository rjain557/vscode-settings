<objective>
Generate a cross-platform mobile application for iOS and Android using React Native with Expo. Supports Azure AD SSO, push notifications, biometric auth, and offline-first data sync.

The user chooses the app type:
- **Full app**: Complete mobile app with tab navigation, auth, push notifications, offline support
- **Companion app**: Lightweight companion to the web app (notifications, quick actions, status)
- **Admin app**: Internal staff app (dashboard, user management, approvals)

Default: generates for both iOS and Android. Pass a platform name to target one.
