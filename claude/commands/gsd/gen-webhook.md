<objective>
Generate webhook infrastructure for sending and receiving webhooks with reliable delivery.

The user chooses direction:
- **Outbound**: Your app sends webhooks to external systems when events occur. Includes subscription management, HMAC signing, retries, and dead letter queue.
- **Inbound**: Your app receives webhooks from external systems. Includes signature verification, replay protection, and provider-specific handlers.
- **Both**: Full bidirectional webhook system.

Auto-discovers webhook events from your existing controllers and data mutations. Follows SPOnly and API-First patterns.
