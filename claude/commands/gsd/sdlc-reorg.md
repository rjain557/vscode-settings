<objective>
Reorganize repository files to conform to the Technijian SDLC v6.0 canonical folder structure. Classifies all files, moves them to standardized locations, updates references, and validates builds.

Orchestrator role: Parse flags, confirm with user (destructive operation), verify clean git state, spawn sdlc-repo-organizer agent, present results.

</execution_context>

<context>
Flags: $ARGUMENTS
- (no flags): Full reorganization with user confirmation
- --dry-run: Classify and plan only — no files moved (safe/read-only)
- --classify-only: Run classifier agent only — output classification report
- --agent=name: Run specific agent only (code, test, docs, database, design, scripts)
</context>

<process>

## 1. Parse Flags

Determine execution scope from $ARGUMENTS.

## 2. Safety Confirmation (skip for --dry-run and --classify-only)

Use AskUserQuestion:
"Repository reorganization will move files to the SDLC v6.0 folder structure. A backup will be created at .reorg-backup/ and all work will happen on a dedicated branch. Do you want to proceed?"

Options: "Yes, proceed" / "No, cancel"

If not confirmed: exit with message "Reorganization cancelled."

## 3. Verify Clean Working Tree (skip for --dry-run and --classify-only)

Check git status. If uncommitted changes exist:
> **Cannot proceed:** You have uncommitted changes. Please commit or stash your changes first, then re-run this command.

Exit without proceeding.

## 4. Spawn sdlc-repo-organizer Agent

Spawn via Task tool:
- description: "SDLC Repo Reorganization ({mode})"
- prompt: Include mode, and references to reorganization agent docs

The agent will:
1. Create backup and reorganization branch (unless dry-run)
2. Classify all files with target paths
3. Execute reorganization agents in dependency order
4. Validate builds after moves
5. Produce move manifest and validation report

## 5. Present Results

If --dry-run:
> **Dry Run Complete**
> {N} files classified. {M} would be moved.
> Classification report at: {path}
> Re-run without --dry-run to execute moves.

If --classify-only:
> **Classification Complete**
> {N} files classified across {types}.
> Report at: {path}

If full reorganization:
> **Reorganization Complete**
> - Files moved: {N}
> - Build status: {pass/fail}
> - Test status: {pass/fail}
> - Branch: reorg/sdlc-v6-structure
>
> Review changes and merge when ready.

If build failed:
> **Reorganization completed with build failures.**
> {error details}
> Check validation report at: {path}

</process>
