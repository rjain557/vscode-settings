<purpose>
Orchestrate a comprehensive, dev-handoff-quality code review across any project type.

Auto-detects project components (Web Frontend, Backend API, Database, Auth/SSO, MCP Server, Mobile App, Browser Extension, Remote Agent) and spawns only the relevant review agents.

Each agent writes findings directly to docs/review/layers/. The orchestrator consolidates into prioritized reports.

Output: docs/review/ folder with executive summary, full report, developer handoff, and prioritized tasks.
</purpose>

<philosophy>
**Universal, not framework-specific:**
This review works for any project type. Checklists adapt based on detected components.

**Dev-handoff quality:**
Every finding includes file path, line numbers, evidence, fix approach, and time estimate. The output is immediately actionable.

**Agents write directly:**
Sub-agents write their findings to files. The orchestrator only reads summaries. This prevents context exhaustion on large codebases.

**Build verification is mandatory:**
A review that doesn't verify the build is incomplete. Build failures are BLOCKER severity.

**Detect, don't assume:**
Never assume a component exists. Always detect first, then review only what's there.
</philosophy>

<process>

<step name="init_context" priority="first">
Load review context:

```bash
INIT=$(node C:/Users/rjain/.codex/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js init code-review 2>/dev/null || echo '{}')
```

If init fails (command not registered yet), proceed with defaults:
- `reviewer_model`: use the model from parent context
- `commit_docs`: true

Check for existing review:
```bash
ls docs/review/ 2>/dev/null
```

If exists, ask user: Refresh (delete and re-review), or Skip.

Create output directories:
```bash
mkdir -p docs/review/layers
```
</step>

<step name="repo_inventory">
Perform Phase 0 repository inventory. This runs in the orchestrator (not a sub-agent).

**1. Detect project roots:**
```bash
# Find all project manifests
find . -maxdepth 3 -name "*.sln" -o -name "*.csproj" -o -name "package.json" -o -name "go.mod" -o -name "pyproject.toml" -o -name "Cargo.toml" -o -name "manifest.json" -o -name "app.json" 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules | grep -v .git
```

**2. Component detection matrix:**

For each potential component, check markers and assign confidence:

| Component | HIGH confidence (2+ markers) | MEDIUM (1 marker) |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Web Frontend | package.json + (react\|vue\|angular\|svelte) + src/**/*.tsx | Any *.tsx or *.vue files |
| Backend .NET | *.csproj + Controllers/ + Program.cs | *.csproj alone |
| Backend Node | package.json + (express\|fastify\|hono\|koa) + src/server.* | routes/ directory |
| Backend Python | (requirements.txt\|pyproject.toml) + (flask\|django\|fastapi) | app.py + requirements.txt |
| Backend Go | go.mod + main.go + internal/ | go.mod alone |
| Database SQL | db/sql/*.sql with CREATE TABLE/PROCEDURE | Any *.sql files |
| Database Mongo | mongoose in package.json + models/ | mongodb connection string |
| MCP Server | @modelcontextprotocol/sdk in package.json OR McpServer class | mcp.json file |
| Mobile RN | react-native in package.json + (ios/ OR android/) | app.json with expo |
| Browser Extension | manifest.json with manifest_version field | content_scripts/ directory |
| Remote Agent | AgentService/BackgroundService + connection management | agent.config.* file |
| Auth/SSO | MSAL config OR [Authorize] attributes OR JWT middleware | auth/ directory |

**3. Map detected components:**

For each detected component, gather:
- File count and total lines
- Key entry points
- Public API surface (endpoints, exports, tools)
- Test coverage indicators

**4. Quick red flag scan:**
```bash
# Hardcoded secrets patterns (NEVER read .env files)
grep -rn "password\s*=\s*['\"]" --include="*.cs" --include="*.ts" --include="*.json" . 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules | grep -v .git | head -20

# TODO/FIXME/HACK counts
grep -rc "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX\|NotImplementedException" --include="*.cs" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" . 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules | grep -v ":0$" | sort -t: -k2 -rn | head -20

# 'any' type usage (TypeScript)
grep -rc "as any\|: any" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" . 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules | grep -v ":0$" | sort -t: -k2 -rn | head -10

# Empty catch blocks
grep -rn "catch.*{" --include="*.cs" --include="*.ts" -A1 . 2>/dev/null | grep -B1 "^\s*}" | grep -v node_modules | head -20
```

**5. Build state check (quick):**
Run a fast build check and note pass/fail. Full verification happens in wave 3.

Store inventory as structured notes for sub-agent prompts.
</step>

<step name="determine_review_scope">
Based on detected components, determine which review agents to spawn.

Map components to reviewer types:

| Detected Component | Reviewer Agent | Checklist Section |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Web Frontend | frontend-reviewer | CHECKLIST_FRONTEND |
| Backend .NET | dotnet-backend-reviewer | CHECKLIST_DOTNET_BACKEND |
| Backend Node | node-backend-reviewer | CHECKLIST_NODE_BACKEND |
| Backend Python | python-backend-reviewer | CHECKLIST_PYTHON_BACKEND |
| Backend Go | go-backend-reviewer | CHECKLIST_GO_BACKEND |
| Database SQL | sql-database-reviewer | CHECKLIST_SQL_DATABASE |
| Database Mongo | mongo-database-reviewer | CHECKLIST_MONGO_DATABASE |
| MCP Server | mcp-server-reviewer | CHECKLIST_MCP_SERVER |
| Mobile RN | mobile-reviewer | CHECKLIST_MOBILE |
| Browser Extension | extension-reviewer | CHECKLIST_EXTENSION |
| Remote Agent | agent-reviewer | CHECKLIST_REMOTE_AGENT |
| Auth/SSO | auth-reviewer | CHECKLIST_AUTH |

Only spawn agents for components with HIGH or MEDIUM confidence.

Present detection results to user before proceeding:
```
Detected Components:
  [HIGH]   Web Frontend (React 18 + TypeScript)

<step name="spawn_cross_cutting">
Spawn 2-3 parallel cross-cutting analysis agents.

**Agent: Traceability Matrix Builder**
```
subagent_type: "general-purpose"
run_in_background: true
description: "Build traceability matrix"
```

Prompt:
```
You are a traceability analyst. For this project, map every user-facing feature through the full stack.

For EACH feature/endpoint, trace:
  UI Component â†’ API Client method â†’ HTTP Route â†’ Controller action â†’ Service/Repository method â†’ SP/Query â†’ Database tables

Write to: docs/review/TRACEABILITY-MATRIX.md

Format as a table. FLAG any broken links:
- Frontend calls an API method that doesn't exist
- Controller calls a repository method that doesn't exist
- Repository calls a SP that doesn't exist
- SP references a table/column that doesn't exist
- API client type doesn't match backend DTO
- Orphaned endpoints (no frontend caller)
- Orphaned SPs (no backend caller)

{Include inventory data}
```

**Agent: Contract Alignment Checker**
```
subagent_type: "general-purpose"
run_in_background: true
description: "Check API contracts"
```

Prompt:
```
You are an API contract alignment checker. For every API endpoint in this project, verify the contract between frontend and backend.

For each endpoint, check:
1. Frontend TypeScript type field names match backend DTO property names exactly
2. Frontend API client sends correct HTTP method, route, query params, body shape
3. Backend DTO property types are compatible with frontend TypeScript types
4. Pagination shapes match (page/pageSize vs skip/take, response wrapper shape)
5. Search/filter parameter names match
6. Date formats are consistent
7. Enum values match between frontend and backend
8. Null/undefined handling is consistent

Write to: docs/review/CONTRACT-ALIGNMENT.md

For each mismatch found, include:
- Endpoint: {method} {route}
- Frontend: {what frontend sends/expects}
- Backend: {what backend expects/returns}
- Severity: BLOCKER if runtime failure, HIGH if data loss, MEDIUM if edge case

{Include inventory data}
```

**Agent: Dead Code Analyzer** (only if codebase > 30 files)
```
subagent_type: "general-purpose"
run_in_background: true
description: "Analyze dead code"
```

Prompt:
```
You are a dead code analyzer. Find all unreferenced, orphaned, or deprecated code in this project.

Check for:
1. Exported functions/types never imported anywhere
2. API client methods never called from any component or hook
3. React hooks defined but never used
4. Components defined but not in any route or imported
5. Controller endpoints with no frontend caller
6. Repository methods never called from any controller/service
7. Stored procedures never called from any repository
8. Database tables not referenced in any SP or query
9. CSS classes/styles not referenced
10. Config values not read anywhere
11. Test files for deleted components
12. Import statements for removed packages

Write to: docs/review/DEAD-CODE.md

Group by: Frontend Dead Code, Backend Dead Code, Database Dead Code, Other.
For each item: file path, what it is, why it's dead (no references found).

{Include inventory data}

Wait for all agents to complete.
</step>

<step name="build_verification">
Run build verification (MANDATORY â€” do this in the orchestrator, not a sub-agent):

**Detect and run appropriate build commands:**

For .NET backend:
```bash
dotnet build {path-to-csproj} --nologo --verbosity quiet 2>&1
```

For TypeScript/React frontend:
```bash
cd {frontend-dir} && npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1
```

For React Native mobile:
```bash
cd {mobile-dir} && npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1
# Also: npx expo doctor 2>&1
```

For Browser Extension:
```bash
cd {extension-dir} && npm run build 2>&1
```

For Go backend:
```bash
cd {go-dir} && go build ./... 2>&1
```

For Python backend:
```bash
cd {python-dir} && python -m py_compile {main-files} 2>&1

- [ ] Command authorization (agent can't execute arbitrary code)
- [ ] TLS for transport encryption
- [ ] Credential rotation support

**Reliability:**
- [ ] Service auto-restarts on crash
- [ ] Logging for debugging (structured logs)
- [ ] Health check endpoint or status reporting
- [ ] Graceful shutdown (finish current work before stopping)

**Observability:**
- [ ] Metrics exported (commands processed, errors, latency)
- [ ] Log levels configurable
- [ ] Trace correlation for distributed requests

## CHECKLIST_AUTH

### Authentication & Authorization Review

**Authentication Flow:**
- [ ] Login flow works end-to-end (SSO redirect, token exchange, session creation)
- [ ] Token refresh flow handles expired tokens silently
- [ ] Logout invalidates both client and server sessions
- [ ] Session persistence across browser refresh
- [ ] Post-login redirect honors original URL (not hardcoded dashboard)

**Authorization:**
- [ ] Every API endpoint has explicit auth requirement ([Authorize] or equivalent)
- [ ] Role checks match requirements (Admin, ExamReviewer, Candidate, etc.)
- [ ] No [AllowAnonymous] on endpoints that handle sensitive data
- [ ] Frontend route guards match backend role requirements
- [ ] Resource ownership verified (users can only access their own data)

**Token Security:**
- [ ] JWT secret/key is strong and not hardcoded
- [ ] Token expiration is reasonable (access: 15-60min, refresh: days-weeks)
- [ ] Refresh tokens are single-use or bound to session
- [ ] Tokens stored securely (httpOnly cookies or secure storage, not localStorage for refresh)
- [ ] Token claims contain minimal necessary data

**CORS & Headers:**
- [ ] CORS origins restricted to known domains
- [ ] Credentials flag set correctly
- [ ] Security headers present (X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] No wildcard CORS (*) on authenticated endpoints

**SSO / MSAL Specific (if applicable):**
- [ ] Client ID and tenant ID from environment variables (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Redirect URI matches Azure AD app registration
- [ ] Scopes are minimal and correct
- [ ] Multi-account handling (if needed)
